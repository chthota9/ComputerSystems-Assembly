Lab 2: Introduction to Logic with MultiMedia Logic
01J, Eshan Hemmati

What Did I Learn:
    First of all I learned how to use MMl. While using MML, I was able to learn a more visual representation
    of logic gates. It was easier to understand how the specfic logic gates worked by having LEDS light up that 
    show if it was either True or False. 

What Was Surprising:
    I was surpised how I could create some different Logic gates simply by inverting the truth/false value. For instance,
    how NAND is the inverted version of AND. I was also surprised how easily it was to represent truth tables with
    the MML software and circuits

What Worked Well:
    I really like how the LEDS worked with the logic gates because it provided a more visual representation. Also,
    the ability to represent the logic gates worked really well I was able to see the truth values, which made it 
    more understandable.

What Did Not Work Well:
    Especially in Part C and Part D, where we had to make our own logic gates to represent the end truth value, 
    some logic gates that I thought would work did not. Also, MML software is pretty outdated so it was hard to
    work with but, I eventually got used to it.

How would you make your own 7-segment display from Part B if you didnâ€™t have one in MML?
    I would get 7 LED lights and circuit wires that represent logic gates. Using boolean alegbra I would input value 
    that would light up certain segements of the LED lights. 

How do you think the random number generator works?
    A random number generator probably works with a algorithm behind it. So basically I think, for every input the random
    algorithm runs its code to output a random truth value. Even though it appears random, since its being generated
    by code it isn't exactly random. 

How can things be really random in a computer when it is made of logic gates, which are
supposed to be deterministic?
    As stated above, I don't think things that are generated from a random number generator are really random. This
    is because it is always spwaned by an algorithm. Therefore the output is being determined by something definite 
    and not random.
